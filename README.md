From the foreword written by Alan J. Perlis for **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 2nd Edition**:
> _"To appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its own right you must turn to computer programming; you must read and write computer programs - many of them. It doesn't matter much what the programs are about or what applications they serve. What does matter is how well they perform and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of still greater programs."_
